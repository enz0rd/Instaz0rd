# Instaz0rd - Project Documentation

**Instaz0rd** is a social network inspired by Instagram, developed by [enz0rd](https://github.com/enz0rd/instaz0rd). This project is a web platform that allows users to share memories and interact with others.

## Prerequisites

To set up and run the Instaz0rd project, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enz0rd/instaz0rd.git
cd instaz0rd
```

## Installing Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

npm install
```

## Configuring XAMPP

1. Download and install XAMPP.
2. Start Apache and MySQL through the XAMPP control panel.
3. Configure the database according to the instructions provided in the repository or in the project's configuration file.

## Available Scripts

The following npm commands are available to start the project:

### Start the frontend development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the frontend development server using Vite.
